### About this site

I guess I can tell you a little bit about myself. I'm currently a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a MS degree in biostatistics. I come from a pharmaceutical sciences background and am experienced in cancer research. I'm looking forward to work as a data scientist in healthcare field after graduation.

Beyond my professiontial interest, I have loads of hobbies that I enjoy, such as:

* Cooking and eating (Hunan cuisine is my all-time favorate for sure!)
* Scuba diving and trekking.
* Literature. I wish I could be a part-time writer some day (not in English). 
* Newly-developed interest in amazing *Nintendo*!
