title: "About me"
---

I guess I can tell you a little bit about myself. I'm currently a first year graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a MS degree in biostatistics. I come from a pharmaceutical sciences background with expertise in cancer research. I'm experienced in R, SAS, SQL and also data analysis. I'm looking forward to work as a data scientist in healthcare field after graduation!

Beyond my professiontial interest, I have loads of hobbies that I enjoy, such as:

* Cooking and eating (Hunan cuisine is my all-time favorate for sure!)
* Scuba diving and trekking.
* Literature. I wish I could be a part-time writer some day (not in English). 
* Newly-developed interest in amazing *Nintendo*!
